### Space Shooter Game
This project implements a 2D arcade-style space shooter game developed using the Unity game engine. The player controls a spacecraft navigating through space while facing waves of incoming enemies. The core gameplay focuses on real-time player movement, shooting mechanics, collision detection and basic scoring logic. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases through faster enemy movement and more frequent enemy spawns, requiring quick reactions and strategic positioning from the player. The game was developed as part of a learning process using an online course, serving as a practical exercise in understanding Unity fundamentals, C# scripting and basic game development workflows.
